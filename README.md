# After-Effects-Snippets

A bunch of scripts / snippets for After Effects. 

Mostly scripts (.jsx) that need to be run via eval() or File > Scripts > etc.

Some are expression snippets. 

## This is not much of anything yet

It's kind of a graveyard, but I will actually be using this to store my AE Snippets in the near future.
